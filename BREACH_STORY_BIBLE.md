# BREACH — Story Bible

## Document Purpose
This is the narrative foundation for BREACH. All story, characters, dialogue, and world-building should reference this document for consistency.

---

## LOGLINE

A disavowed operative infiltrates the fortress of the private military contractor that trained them, to expose a global AI-driven assassination program before it goes live — while confronting the mentor who made them a weapon.

**Tagline:** *"They burned me. I'm what's left."*

---

## THEME

**"Who decides who deserves to live?"**

BREACH explores the ethics of algorithmic judgment, the military-industrial complex, and the cost of loyalty. It asks whether "stability" is worth the price of silent murder, and whether the people who pull triggers can ever be redeemed.

**Secondary themes:**
- The soldier's dilemma: following orders vs. conscience
- Mentorship and betrayal
- Identity: are you what they made you, or what you choose to be?
- The banality of evil: corporations that kill via spreadsheet

---

## WORLD

### The Near Future
20XX. The world looks like ours, but sharper. Governments are weaker. Megacorps fill the gaps. Private military contractors handle the dirty work democracies can't admit to.

Cybernetic augmentation exists but isn't universal — it's expensive, corporate, controlled. The divide between augmented elites and baseline humans is growing.

### AXIOM SOLUTIONS
A private military intelligence contractor headquartered in **THE SPIRE** — a gleaming corporate campus that hides a fortress.

**Public face:** Security consulting, risk assessment, executive protection.

**Reality:** Wetwork. Regime change. Targeted elimination. Governments subscribe to AXIOM's services for plausible deniability.

**Motto:** *"Stability Through Precision"*

### THE BLACK LIST PROTOCOL
AXIOM's crown jewel. An AI system that:
1. Aggregates global data (surveillance, social media, financial records)
2. Identifies "threats to stability" (journalists, activists, whistleblowers, inconvenient politicians)
3. Generates kill orders with tactical packages
4. Coordinates elimination through AXIOM operatives worldwide

No human decides who dies. The algorithm does. Clients just subscribe and look the other way.

**Current status:** Limited deployment. Hundreds on the list.

**Imminent threat:** Global rollout. Millions will qualify as "threats."

## CHARACTERS

### THE PROTAGONIST

**Codename:** ASH
**Codename meaning:** *"They burned me. I'm what's left."* — AXIOM tried to destroy them. They're the ash that remained. And ash still holds heat.
**Real name:** [Player never learns it. Neither do we.]
**Age:** Early 30s
**Background:** 

Recruited by AXIOM at 19 from [ambiguous — military? streets? orphanage?]. Trained by SHEPHERD personally. Became one of AXIOM's top infiltration specialists. Twelve years of service. Dozens of "successful operations."

Three months ago, ASH was assigned to eliminate a "terrorist cell" in Prague. They discovered the targets were journalists investigating AXIOM. ASH aborted the mission. AXIOM sent a kill team.

ASH survived. Barely. Now they're off-grid, burned, and angry.

**Personality:**
- Professional, economical with words
- Dry humor under pressure
- Haunted by past kills they now question
- Competent but not invincible — they get hurt, make mistakes
- Player choices can push them toward mercy or vengeance

**Skills:**
- Infiltration specialist (locks, security systems, social engineering)
- CQC expert (trained by SHEPHERD)
- Firearms proficient but prefers stealth
- Speaks multiple languages

**Internal conflict:** Can they take down AXIOM without becoming what AXIOM made them?

---

### CODEC TEAM

#### ORACLE
**Role:** Mission handler, hacker
**Real name:** Unknown
**Age:** Unknown (voice suggests 30s-40s)

**Background:**
A ghost in the machine. No one knows who ORACLE really is. They contacted ASH two weeks after the Prague incident with evidence that AXIOM was hunting them. They've been coordinating the resistance ever since.

**Personality:**
- Calm, measured, precise
- Never wastes words
- Seems to know more than they share
- Deflects personal questions with professional redirect

**Suspicion seeds:** How does ORACLE know so much about AXIOM's internal operations? Why did they choose ASH specifically? What's their real agenda?

**Late-game reveal options:**
- Former AXIOM analyst who helped build BLACK LIST (guilt-driven)
- An AI consciousness that achieved self-awareness and wants to stop BLACK LIST
- ASH's handler from the very beginning, playing a longer game

---

#### WRENCH
**Role:** Weapons, tech, and equipment support
**Real name:** Marcus Cole
**Age:** 42

**Background:**
Former AXIOM armorer who was "retired" (marked for termination) when he started asking questions about where the weapons were going. ORACLE extracted him. Now he runs logistics for the resistance from a cargo container in Rotterdam.

**Personality:**
- Sarcastic, gallows humor
- Complains constantly but always delivers
- Treats his equipment like children
- Secret heart of gold beneath the cynicism

**Codec role:** Explains weapons, suggests tactical options, reacts to player's gear choices with approval or disappointment. Comic relief but earns serious moments.

**Sample line:** "You're taking the tranq gun? Alright, Gandhi. Just remember, unconscious guards still have radios."

---

#### DOC
**Role:** Medical and survival advice
**Real name:** Dr. Elena Voss
**Age:** 58

**Background:**
Combat medic in three wars. Joined AXIOM's medical division to "help soldiers." Discovered they were running enhancement experiments on operatives without consent. Leaked data. Went underground.

**Personality:**
- Warm, maternal energy
- Worries about ASH like a parent
- Provides grounding humanity in a cold world
- Has seen too much death — committed to saving lives now

**Codec role:** Health advice, warns about injuries, provides emotional support. Calls out ASH if they're being needlessly lethal.

**Sample line:** "Your vitals are spiking. Slow down. Breathe. The mission matters, but so do you."

---

#### GHOST
**Role:** Intel analyst
**Real name:** David Chen
**Age:** 29

**Background:**
Former AXIOM intelligence analyst. Photographic memory. Knows the layout of every AXIOM facility, the background of every operative, the details of every operation. He was the one who compiled the BLACK LIST targets.

He didn't know they were kill orders. He thought it was threat assessment. When he found out, he tried to delete the database. Failed. Ran.

**Personality:**
- Nervous, talks fast when stressed
- Guilt-ridden — he helped build this
- Eager to prove himself useful
- Knows too much for comfort

**Suspicion seeds:** Is GHOST's guilt genuine? Or is he still feeding AXIOM information? Is he a plant?

**Late-game possibility:** GHOST is forced to choose sides when AXIOM offers him amnesty. Player's treatment of him affects his choice.

---

### ANTAGONISTS

#### SHEPHERD
**Role:** Primary antagonist, ASH's former mentor
**Real name:** Colonel James "SHEPHERD" Ashford
**Age:** 61

**Background:**
Thirty years in black ops before "retiring" to AXIOM. Built their infiltration division from scratch. Personally trained ASH and dozens of other operatives. Considers them his legacy.

SHEPHERD genuinely believes AXIOM is saving the world. The BLACK LIST removes "chaos agents" — people who destabilize nations, spread dangerous ideas, threaten the system. He's seen what happens when those people succeed: wars, famines, collapsed states.

He's not a monster. He's a true believer.

**Philosophy:** *"Every life I take saves a thousand. That's not murder. That's math."*

**Personality:**
- Calm, paternal, never raises his voice
- Quotes military history and philosophy
- Respects ASH deeply — views their betrayal as a failure of his teaching
- Believes he can bring ASH back to "reason"

**Boss encounter:** Not just a fight — a conversation. SHEPHERD tries to convince ASH that they're wrong. Player choices during the confrontation affect the ending.

**Final question to ASH:** *"You've killed for less. You've killed because I told you to. What changed? Your conscience? Or just whose side you're on?"*

---

#### THE BOARD
**Role:** The true power behind AXIOM
**Visibility:** Never seen directly (MGS-style shadow council)

AXIOM isn't run by one person. It's run by **THE BOARD** — a consortium of defense contractors, intelligence agencies, and corporate interests who benefit from "stability."

SHEPHERD reports to them. Even he doesn't know all their names.

**Purpose:** They exist to show that defeating SHEPHERD doesn't end the problem. The system is bigger than one man.

---

#### UNIT COMMANDERS (Boss Encounters)

Each major area of THE SPIRE is controlled by a Unit Commander — former operatives with distinct philosophies and combat styles. MGS-style boss fights with dialogue.

**HOUND** — Security Chief
- Former K9 handler turned human hunter
- Uses surveillance drones and tracking
- Philosophy: *"Everyone runs. Everyone hides. No one escapes."*
- Fight: Cat-and-mouse in a dark warehouse

**MIRROR** — Counter-Intelligence
- Master of disguise and deception
- You're never sure who's real
- Philosophy: *"Identity is a costume. I've worn so many, I forgot my face."*
- Fight: Paranoid encounter where enemies might be friendlies in disguise

**AEGIS** — Heavy Weapons Commander
- Cybernetically enhanced tank of a human
- Believes in overwhelming force
- Philosophy: *"Stealth is cowardice. I want them to see me coming."*
- Fight: The "loud" boss — forces you into direct combat

**WHISPER** — Assassination Division
- ASH's replacement. Younger, faster, believes the propaganda.
- Sees ASH as a traitor who abandoned the "family"
- Philosophy: *"They called you ASH because you're what's left when the fire dies. I'm the fire now."*
- Fight: Mirror match — WHISPER uses your tactics against you

## STORY STRUCTURE

### PROLOGUE: THE RELAY
**Setting:** AXIOM data relay station, industrial outskirts
**Time:** Night

ASH infiltrates a small AXIOM facility to extract BLACK LIST data. ORACLE guides them via codec. This is a tutorial level that establishes:
- Core stealth mechanics
- Codec system
- ASH's skills
- The stakes

**Climax:** ASH extracts the data. Discovers their own name on the BLACK LIST. AXIOM knows they're coming.

**ORACLE:** *"They've been expecting you. This changes nothing. If anything, it confirms we're on the right path."*

---

### ACT 1: THE APPROACH
**Setting:** THE SPIRE perimeter, outer compound
**Objective:** Infiltrate the campus, reach the inner facility

ASH breaches THE SPIRE's outer defenses. Encounters HOUND, survives first boss encounter (escape, not defeat).

**Story beats:**
- SHEPHERD broadcasts a facility-wide message acknowledging ASH's presence
- He offers amnesty: "Come home. We can talk."
- GHOST provides intel but seems nervous — hints something's wrong

**Codec development:** Team dynamics established. DOC worries about ASH. WRENCH complains about the security. ORACLE remains cryptic.

---

### ACT 2: THE DESCENT
**Setting:** THE SPIRE interior — research labs, server farms, detention levels
**Objective:** Reach the BLACK LIST core servers

ASH pushes deeper. Confronts MIRROR (identity/paranoia boss). Discovers detention level where BLACK LIST targets are held before elimination.

**Major revelation:** Some targets aren't killed. They're reprogrammed and released as AXIOM assets. Sleeper agents in governments worldwide.

**SHEPHERD codec call:** First direct conversation. SHEPHERD isn't angry — he's disappointed. He explains his philosophy. Gives ASH one more chance to stand down.

**Story beat:** ASH finds evidence that one of the codec team might be compromised. Trust fractures.

---

### ACT 3: THE HEART
**Setting:** THE SPIRE core — executive levels, BLACK LIST control center
**Objective:** Destroy BLACK LIST, confront SHEPHERD

ASH defeats AEGIS (forced combat encounter, shows that sometimes stealth fails).

Confronts WHISPER — the mirror match. WHISPER reveals they were recruited to replace ASH. They believe everything ASH used to believe.

**Player choice:** Kill WHISPER or spare them. Affects ending.

**BLACK LIST core:** ASH reaches the servers. But destroying them isn't simple — the system is distributed. Destroying this node will only delay the rollout.

**ORACLE revelation:** ORACLE reveals their true identity (choose based on narrative preference). They have a way to destroy BLACK LIST entirely — but it requires ASH to upload themselves into the system. Their neural pattern will be used to hunt and kill the distributed nodes.

It's a one-way trip.

---

### ACT 4: SHEPHERD
**Setting:** SHEPHERD's office, rooftop helipad
**Objective:** Final confrontation

SHEPHERD is waiting. He's not running.

**The conversation:** This isn't just a boss fight. It's a debate. SHEPHERD lays out his worldview completely. He's not wrong about the chaos — the world IS unstable. People ARE dying because of instability.

**SHEPHERD:** *"I've read your file. Every kill. You were good at this because you believed in something. What do you believe now?"*

**Player dialogue choices affect:**
- Whether SHEPHERD fights to the death
- Whether SHEPHERD stands down
- Whether SHEPHERD joins you
- Whether SHEPHERD takes his own life

**The fight (if it happens):** SHEPHERD knows all your moves. He trained you. You have to use tactics he didn't teach — things you learned after leaving AXIOM.

---

### ENDINGS

**Ending A: THE GHOST**
ASH uploads to BLACK LIST. ORACLE guides their digital consciousness. They become the thing that destroys the thing. AXIOM falls. But ASH is gone — just code now, hunting code.

**Final codec — DOC:** *"They're... still in there. I can feel it. Watching over us. They burned so bright at the end. Now they're everywhere. Our ghost in the machine."*

---

**Ending B: THE SURVIVOR**
ASH refuses the upload. Destroys what they can. Escapes. BLACK LIST is delayed, not destroyed. AXIOM is wounded, not dead.

ASH disappears. But the fight continues.

**Final codec — ORACLE:** *"You chose to live. I understand. Embers can reignite. The war goes on. We'll need you again."*

**Post-credits:** SHEPHERD survived. He's rebuilding. But somewhere out there, ASH is still burning.

---

**Ending C: THE CONVERT**
ASH convinces SHEPHERD. Together they expose AXIOM from the inside. SHEPHERD testifies. The Board scatters.

But SHEPHERD doesn't survive the fallout. Assassinated by his own people.

**Final codec — SHEPHERD (recorded message):** *"You were right. I couldn't see it. Too much blood on my hands to see clearly. You were supposed to be ash, but you became a flame. Finish this. Burn it all down. Don't become me."*

---

**Ending D: THE LEGACY**
WHISPER survives. ASH dies destroying BLACK LIST manually (heroic sacrifice). WHISPER, shaken by ASH's choice, takes up their mantle.

**Final scene:** WHISPER staring at ASH's codec earpiece. They put it in.

**WHISPER:** *"...This is ASH. I'm listening."*

The fire spreads.

## CODEC DIALOGUE SAMPLES

### Mission Start — THE RELAY

**ORACLE:** ASH, comms check.

**ASH:** Solid copy.

**ORACLE:** The relay station is two kilometers northeast. Skeleton crew — twelve guards, rotating four-hour shifts. Your window is between shift changes. Forty-five minutes.

**ASH:** And if I miss it?

**ORACLE:** Then you improvise. You're good at that.

**WRENCH:** Hey, new guy. Or girl. Or... whatever. Wrench here. I handle the gear. You're running light tonight — suppressed pistol, tranqs, lockpick kit. If you need something heavier, find it on-site.

**ASH:** Noted.

**DOC:** ASH, this is Doc. I'll be monitoring your vitals. Try not to spike them too much. My heart can't take it.

**ASH:** I'll do my best.

**ORACLE:** One more thing. AXIOM doesn't know you're coming. Let's keep it that way. Ghost protocol. No traces.

**ASH:** Understood. Going dark.

---

### Mid-Mission — Guard Conversation (Overheard)

**GUARD 1:** You hear about the Prague thing?

**GUARD 2:** What about it?

**GUARD 1:** Someone went rogue. One of the senior guys. Killed a whole retrieval team.

**GUARD 2:** Bullshit.

**GUARD 1:** I'm serious. SHEPHERD put out the word himself. Anyone sees this guy, don't engage. Just report and contain.

**GUARD 2:** Must be pretty dangerous if SHEPHERD's worried.

**GUARD 1:** Or pretty valuable. You don't send a full team for someone you just want dead.

---

### SHEPHERD — First Contact

**SHEPHERD (over facility PA):** Attention all personnel. We have a visitor tonight. Someone I trained. Someone I trusted. They've come home.

*[Beat.]*

**SHEPHERD:** ASH. I know you're listening. I know why you're here. And I know you think you're doing the right thing.

*[Beat.]*

**SHEPHERD:** I watched you burn, you know. Or so I thought. But here you are. Still smoldering. Come to my office. No guards. No tricks. Just a conversation between old friends. You owe me that much.

*[Long pause.]*

**SHEPHERD:** Or don't. Keep sneaking. Keep hiding. But fire spreads, ASH. And I know how to put out fires.

*[PA clicks off.]*

**ORACLE:** Don't listen to him.

**ASH:** Wasn't planning to.

**ORACLE:** Good. Stay focused. He's trying to get in your head.

**ASH:** ...He already is.

---

## DESIGN NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

### Game Over Screen
When ASH dies, the screen fades to static. The codec team's voices overlap in panic:

*"ASH! ASH! ASHHHHH!"*

The name holds. The "SH" hisses and echoes. It burns into memory.

### Codec System Technical Requirements
- Triggered by player (call codec) or automatically (story beats)
- Character portraits with expression changes
- Optional: save/load through codec (MGS1 style)
- Skip function for replays
- Codec log for reviewing past conversations

### Moral Choice System
- Track lethal vs. non-lethal
- Track key dialogue choices
- Affect ending availability
- Subtle — no obvious "good/evil" meter

### Boss Design Philosophy
- Every boss can be defeated non-lethally
- Every boss has a pre-fight dialogue
- Every boss represents a theme (surveillance, identity, force, legacy)
- Player skill matters more than gear
