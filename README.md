## About

BREACH is a story-driven stealth game where you play as **ASH**, a disavowed operative infiltrating the fortress of the private military contractor that trained them — to expose a global AI-driven assassination program before it goes live.

**Genre:** Third-person tactical stealth
**Engine:** Godot 4
**Visual Style:** PS2-era fidelity (MGS2/MGS3 aesthetic)

## Story

AXIOM SOLUTIONS runs BLACK LIST — an AI that identifies "threats to stability" and generates kill orders. Governments subscribe for plausible deniability.

You discovered the truth. They tried to kill you. You survived.

Now you're going back in.
